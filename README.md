# Flora Retro

## About

Flora Retro is a commercial website for a company specializing in wedding and event decorations. The site showcases the companyâ€™s services, highlights selected past projects, and provides a way for customers to get in touch. The design emphasizes elegance and user-friendly navigation to reflect the aesthetic values of the event industry.

## Coding & Problems

I chose Next.js for this project to explore its approach to server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG). Next.js offers powerful tools for SEO, performance optimization, and API integration, making it a great fit for commercial websites. This project also gave me the opportunity to deepen my understanding of React and experiment with features such as file-based routing, dynamic paths, and image optimization.
